🧠 Retinal OCT Disease Classification (8 Classes)

A deep learning–based medical imaging project that classifies 8 retinal diseases from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans using transfer learning and provides visual explainability via Grad-CAM.

Built with PyTorch + Streamlit, this project demonstrates an end-to-end medical AI pipeline — from training to deployment.

🚀 Key Highlights

✅ 8-class retinal disease classification

✅ MobileNetV2 transfer learning (fast & efficient)

✅ Streamlit web application

✅ Grad-CAM heatmap visualization

✅ Modular, clean project structure

✅ Recruiter-friendly & production-ready
